#### What is DEX?

DEX stands for `“decentralized exchange”` and refers to a platform that enables the peer to peer trading of digital assets, otherwise known as cryptocurrencies. A DEX runs on a decentralized or ‘distributed’ database, called a `Blockchain`.

Users sign up to a DEX via a web or mobile app. Then, they can use it to exchange digital assets anonymously with other traders all over the globe, 24/7, and in real-time.

Each DEX has many different trading pairs available for exchange, for example, Bitcoin and Ethereum, or XLM and USDT. Because the trades are happening on a decentralized exchange using a blockchain ledger, they happen very quickly, cheaply, and from any location or time zone.

#### Coin vs Token vs Blockchain vs Protocol

Blockchain is the general technology. Then there are different protocols based on blockchain, and finally you have tokens for the various applications on a protocol.

Very broadly, a crypto `coin` is just that: a coin, or means of payment, whilst a `token` has wider functionality.

Coins are native to their own blockchain. Whilst tokens have been built on top of another blockchain, like Ethereum, NEO, or Waves.

Coins are most often used simply as money; however, some coins do have other uses. These include being used to fuel applications, being used as a stake to validate a transaction on a network, or being used to fuel smart contract and token transactions.

Tokens serve a different purpose. If they were created to be used on a dApp, then their purpose will depend on the application itself. In some cases, they are for features such as voting rights. In other cases, they are used for transactions on the dApp (like Civic) or to reward the users with things like discounted fees, etc. (like Binance).

Protocol are rules & regulations how to communicate with each other in Blockchain.

#### What is Smart Contract and its characteristics?

Smart contract refer to immutable computer programs that run deterministically in the contest of an Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the Ethereum network protocol -- i.e, on the decentralized Ethereum world computer!

**Characteristics:**

- `Computer programs`: Smart contracts are simply computer programs. The word “contract” has no legal meaning in this context.

- `Immutable`: Once deployed, the code of a smart contract cannot change. Unlike with traditional software, the only way to modify a smart contract is to deploy a new instance.

- `Deterministic`: The outcome of the execution of a smart contract is the same for everyone who runs it, given the context of the transaction that initiated its execution and the state of the Ethereum blockchain at the moment of execution.

- `EVM context`: Smart contracts operate with a very limited execution context. They can access their own state, the context of the transaction that called them, and some information about the most recent blocks.

`Decentralized world computer`: The EVM runs as a local instance on every Ethereum node, but because all instances of the EVM operate on the same initial state and produce the same final state, the system as a whole operates as a single “world computer.”
